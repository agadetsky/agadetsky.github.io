Modern variance reduction techniques mostly consider categorical distributions and have limited applicability when the number of possible outcomes becomes large. In this work, we consider models with latent permutations and propose control variates for the Plackett-Luce distribution. In particular, the control variates allow us to optimize black-box functions over permutations using stochastic gradient descent. To illustrate the approach, we consider a variety of causal structure learning tasks for continuous and discrete data. We show that our method outperforms competitive relaxation-based optimization methods and is also applicable to non-differentiable score functions.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={06}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Gadetsky, Artyom and Struminsky, Kirill and Robinson, Christopher and Quadrianto, Novi and Vetrov, Dmitry}, year={2020}, month={Apr.}, pages={10126-10135} }
